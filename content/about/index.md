Hello! I'm Vamsi, a computer science enthusiast majorly interested in Data Engineering and Software Engineering. I'm currently a Master of Computer Science student at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/), Raleigh. I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) (2013-2017). 

At [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/), I had joined as a Software Engineer and later in 2021, I got promoted to Senior Software Engineer. I Inititially started  bulding large data pipelines and later got to develop chatbots and other exciting products. I had designed and maintained a few products which serve JPMC middle office teams and a few external clients. While developing large scale software applications, I got to learn all the best practices in Software design and implementation including requirement gathering, documentation, infrastructure setup, coding and testing (both unit & integration). 

For the summer of 2022, I have the pleasure of interning at [Warner Bros. Discovery](https://wbd.com/). I worked with the Partner Commerce team for HBO Max as a Software Engineering Intern. During my time I had the chance to redesign their App Subscriptions Database to better handle dynamic pricing and efficient querying. I have also extended my project by developing an command line tool (CLI) that can be used to add / update mobile subscriptions.   

Here is a list of the technologies that I had worked recently
