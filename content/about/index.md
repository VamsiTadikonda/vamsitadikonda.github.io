Hello! I'm Vamsi, a computer science enthusiast majorly interested in Data Engineering and Natural Language Processing. I'm currently a Master of Computer Science student at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/), Raleigh. I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) (2013-2017). 

During my time at BITS, I have worked on a couple of NLP related projects like Question Answering Systems, Parts of Speech Tagger and Named Entity Recognizer.

At [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/), I had joined as a Software Engineer and later in 2021, I got promoted to Senior Software Engineer. I Inititially started  bulding large data pipelines and later got to develop chatbots and other exciting products. I had designed and maintained a few products which serve JPMC middle office teams and a few external clients. While developing large scale software applications, I got to learn all the best practices in Software design and implementation including requirement gathering, documentation, infrastructure setup, coding and testing (both unit & integration). 

Here is a list of the technologies that I had worked recently
