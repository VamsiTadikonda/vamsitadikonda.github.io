Hello! I'm Vamsi, a computer science enthusiast majorly interested in Data Engineering and Natural Language Processing. I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) (2013-2017). 

During my time at BITS, I have worked on a couple of NLP related projects like Question Answering Systems, Parts of Speech Tagger and Named Entity Recognizer.

From the past 4 years, I have been working as a Software Engineer at JPMorgan Chase where I have been working on bulding large data pipelines, chatbots and other exciting products. 

Here is a list of the technologies that I have been working recently
